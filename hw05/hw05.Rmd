# Question 1
Using the `here::here` package in R analyses is valuable because it provides a unified way to reference the root directory of your project that avoids the common hiccups that occur when working relative paths in complex project structures and working across both operating systems and R platforms.
The main feature of `here::here` is it automatically detects the root directory of your project, where it could be the folder that contains an `.Rproj` file, a `.here` file, a variety of other files, or simply the current working directory.

First, I'll discuss why using `here::here` is preferable over using relative paths in large projects. 
Often times, when you're working with a large dataset, your project folder will have multiple subfolders. If one of your scripts exists in one subfolder, and you're trying to refer to the contents of another subfolder on the same level, you'll have to use relative paths such as `../subfolder1/file.txt`.
Whereas when you use `here::here`, you can simply just refer to the file by typing `here::here('subfolder1','file.txt')`.

As well, `here::here` is compatible across operating systems.
When using R in Windows, the paths use backslashes in their paths, like this: `C\Users\sean`.
In Unix systems such as Unix and OS X, paths use forward slashes in their paths, like this `/home/seanla/`.
`here::here` allows paths to be cross-compatible across operating systems.

Lastly, `here::here` also allows regular R scripts to work with relative paths.
R scripts don't work with relative paths, so they will fail if you try to work with relative paths like this: `../file.txt`.
You'll have to stick with absolute paths, then.
However, `here::here` allows you to avoid using absolute paths in R scripts.

# Question 2
Let's figure out how many levels we have in `gapminder$continent`.
```{r}
nlevels(gapminder$continent)
```
We have 142 levels.

How many rows do we have?
```{r}
nrow(gapminder)
```

We have 1704 rows.

Let's now filter out `Oceania` from our dataset.
```{r}
gap_sans_oceania <- gapminder %>% filter(continent != 'Oceania')
```

How many rows do we have now?
```{r}
nrow(gap_sans_oceania)
```

1680, less than the number before dropping `Oceania`.

How many factors do we have?
```{r}
nlevels(gap_sans_oceania$continent)
```

We stil have 5 continents as factors, which isn't what we expected!

Let's prune out our unused factors.

```{r}
gap_sans_oceania <- gap_sans_oceania %>% droplevels()
nlevels(gap_sans_oceania$continent)
```

Now we only have four factors in `gapminder$continent`, which is what we want! Perfect.

Let's look at boxplots of each continents population.
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(continent, pop)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

The continent factors seem to be ordered alphabetically.
Let's try ordering the factors based on their standard deviation of GDP per capita.
If a continent has a higher standard deviation in GDP per capita, then that means the GDP per capita of the countries inside the continent are not so consistent.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(continent, pop)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(fct_reorder(continent, gdpPercap, sd)))
```

Let's quickly confirm that our reordering of the factors based on standard deviation of GDP per capita actually worked.
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(gdpPercap_sd = sd(gdpPercap))
```

Indeed, we have Africa first, then Oceania, then Americas, Europe, and then finally Asia. It worked! Huzzuh!

# Question 3
Let's reorder the continents factor in `gapminder` using `forcats::fct_reorder` in descending order based on each continents' median life expectancy.

Before we start, this is what the structure of the `gapminder` dataset looks like before:

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

If we use `arrange` on the original `gapminder` dataset based on the `continent`, we get this.

```{r}
head(arrange(gapminder, continent))
```
This is what the corresponding frequency box plot looks like.

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(continent)) +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("Number of entries") + xlab("Continent")
```

This is what it looks like after reordering continents.

```{r}
shuffled_gap <- gapminder %>% transform(continent = fct_reorder(continent, lifeExp, median, .desc=T))
str(shuffled_gap)
```

Running `fct_reorder` on the `continent` factor based on each continents' median life expectancy in descending order reorders the continent names in the internal representation of the `gapminder` dataset.

Let's run `arrange` on `shuffled_gap` based on `continent` to see how `fct_reorder` effects the results.

```{r}
head(arrange(shuffled_gap, continent))
```

Countries whose continent is Oceania comes up first.
This is different from the original `gapminder` dataset, where running `arrange` displays countries whose continent is Africa first.

The frequency boxplot after reordering looks like this.

```{r}
shuffled_gap %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(continent)) +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("Number of entries") + xlab("Continent")
```

The boxes are flipped with respect to the x axis.

Let's now save our shuffled `gapminder` dataset using `here::here`.

```{r}
write_csv(shuffled_gap, path = here::here('hw05', 'shuffled_gap.csv'))
```

Let's read our shuffled `gapminder` dataset again.

```{r}
shuffled_gap <- read_csv(file = here::here('hw05', 'shuffled_gap.csv'))
```

Did writing and reading our shuffled `gapminder` dataset preserve the ordering of the `continent` factor?

```{r}
str(shuffled_gap)
```

Nope! R doesn't even recognize that `continent` is a factor variable now.

Running `arrange` on `continent` gives this.

```{r}
head(arrange(shuffled_gap, continent))
```
Running `arrange` gives the same as it was when we were working with the original `gapminder` dataset.

Plotting the frequency box plot of our written-and-read `shuffled_gap` dataset gives this.

```{r}
shuffled_gap %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(continent)) +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("Number of entries") + xlab("Continent")
```

It's back to its default state.

# Question 4

In my assignment 2, I presented the following plot:

```{r}
(old_plot <- gapminder %>% 
               filter(country == 'Canada') %>% 
               ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
                 geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
                 scale_x_log10("GDP per capita", labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
                 theme_bw() +
                 ylab("Life Expectancy") +
                 ggtitle('Original plot'))
```

In class, we learned that one aspect of effective visualizations is removing visual clutter.
One visual clutter in my previous graph could be the grid lines, which might take away from the visualization.
We could also remove the y-axis labels, and label each point directly with its value to emphasize the data.
We could also color the points red to draw the readers' eyes to the datapoints.

```{r}
(new_plot <- gapminder %>% 
               filter(country == 'Canada') %>% 
               ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
                 geom_point(alpha=0.5, color='red') +
                 scale_x_log10("GDP per capita", labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
                 theme_bw() +
                 ylab("Life Expectancy") +
                 theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
                       panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
                       axis.line = element_blank(),
                       axis.ticks = element_blank(),
                       axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
                 geom_text(aes(label = lifeExp), hjust=0.5, vjust=-0.6, size=2.5) +
                 ggtitle("Tidied-up plot"))
```

This looks a lot more clean.

Let's compare the old plot and the new plot on the same figure.

```{r, fig.width=10}
plot_grid(old_plot, new_plot)
```

Our new plot really emphasizes the data now. Without the gridlines, the viewers eyes are directed to the datapoints.
The redness of the datapoints also helps with this, too.
Now that the actual life expectancies of each datapoint are displayed above, the viewer doesn't need to look at the y-axis to get that information.
The lack of y-axis labels also helps with this.

# Question 5
Let's save our new plot!

```{r}
ggsave(here::here('hw05','exercise_5_plot.png'), width=8)
```

For posterity, we'll display it here.
![side-by-side plot](exercise_5_plot.png)

Let's save only our tidied-up plot.
If we want to use `ggsave` again, we can't just call it without specifying the `plot` parameter, because it'll just save our side-by-side plot again.
Let's specify the `plot` parameter directly so we can save our tidied-up plot.

```{r}
ggsave(here::here('hw05','tidied_up_plot.png'), plot = new_plot)
```
Let's display this one, too.

![tidy plot](tidied_up_plot.png)
Beautiful!
